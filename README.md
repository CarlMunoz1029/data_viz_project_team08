In this project, we made vizualisations from patient data to allow for coordinators to see the status and risk factors for patient in order to better distibute staff among said patients. 

## Overview : 
Allows the coordinator to get a general view of which patients had incidents occur to them over the previous 28 days, as well as a feed to display the most recent incidents. 

## Patient view : 
Allows us to see the portion of ADLS (activities of daily living) for a given patient, any incidents they had, and any notes that were written about them, over the last 28 days.
